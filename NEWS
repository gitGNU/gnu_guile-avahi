* New in Guile-Avahi 0.3

** Incompatible changes
*** Require Avahi >= 0.6.4
** Bug fixes
*** Allow use of Avahi <= 0.6.13 by making features conditional
In particular, `error/no-change' and `set-client-host-name!' are conditional.
** New features
*** New procedures: `make-threaded-poll', `threaded-poll', etc.
** Improved documentation
** Packaging
*** New `--with-guilemoduledir' configure flag
*** Switch from GNU Arch to Git for version control

* New in Guile-Avahi 0.2

** Switched to LGPLv3
** Use a custom memory allocator
This allows Guile's GC to make more informed decisions, thereby slightly
reducing average memory usage.
** Bug fixes
*** Fixed garbage collection of clients when a Guile poll is used
*** Fixed garbage collection of Guile polls vs. watches

* New in Guile-Avahi 0.1

** Documentation and test suite improvements
** Bug fixes
*** Export `lookup-result-flag' values (were missing)
*** Resolvers now properly handle NULL addresses
*** Force users to use an explicit finalization API
See node "Explicit Finalization" in the manual.

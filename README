Guile-Avahi is a set of Avahi bindings for GNU Guile 1.8, released under
the LGPL v3 or later.  It allows programmers to use functionalities of
the Avahi client library from Guile Scheme programs.

Service Discovery (DNS-SD).  Together, these protocols provide support
for fully decentralized host naming and service publication and
discovery.
